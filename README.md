And open sourced alternative to the Clock app

It will be a couple hours before I'm able to post a mock up and a set of files to start with.

ClickFlock: A decentralized short-form video platform built on the Bluesky AT Protocol that puts creation power back in users' hands.
The platform runs as a custom feed and client within the AT Protocol ecosystem, letting users share and discover AI-enhanced 15-60 second videos while maintaining control of their data. 

Each ClickFlock instance can be self-hosted with:
A lightweight AI edge model running locally for real-time video effects, object detection, and content moderation without sending data to external servers
Custom embedding server for video storage and delivery, keeping content distribution decentralized, probably going to need IPFS
Integration with the AT Protocol for social features like likes, reposts, and threaded responses
Feed generation algorithms that run locally on user devices rather than centralized servers

Key Features:

- Create and edit videos with AI-powered effects that process locally
- Control your content distribution through IPFS embedding
- Interact seamlessly with the wider Bluesky social ecosystem
- Keep your data private with edge processing to customize recommendation algorithms to your preferences
- Import/export videos from other platforms
- Thread videos together for long-form storytelling
- Built-in creative tools for transitions, text overlays, and sound mixing
- You train and own your own algorithm

ClickFlock demonstrates how decentralized protocols, edge AI, and self-hosted infrastructure can create engaging social video experiences while respecting user privacy and agency.

I could use your help doing everything.
